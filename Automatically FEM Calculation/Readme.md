Automatically mesh the input structures through Hypermesh and conduct similations of compress test via Abaqus
# Automesh
Automatically mesh the input structures. Open the Hypermesh software and run the file via "Run Script" → "Command File" in Hypermesh to use it. Generate .inp files from the input .stl files
# Create_inp
The .inp files directly generated by Hypermesh contains data of 3D structures and 2D masks, run this file to remove the data of 2D masks, and generate new .inp files added with modifiers that include configurations and boundary conditions of Abaqus.
# Calculation
Put this .bat file and the .inp files generated by "Create_inp.py" under the same directory, and run this file to conduct automatically Abaqus simulations.  Make sure there is an accessible Abaqus process on your device.
# Results_extraction
Extract results and generate .rpt files of displacement and reaction force of the models from the .odb files generated after simulations. Run the file via "File" → "run script" in Abaqus to use it.
