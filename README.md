An active learning method that integrates Finite Element Method (FEM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), aiming at high-efficient designs and optimizations for 3D mechanical metamaterials.
# MCTS-AL
Main code of model training and sampling processes of the workflow
# Automatically FEM Calculation
Codes of FEM automations in the workflow. Require .stl files as input and export .rpt files as output
# Gradesd Structure Generation
Generate .stl files of graded Gyroid TPMS structures from the input matrixes, which contained in a .mat file 
# HEA
Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithm (HEA). The HEA algorithm mentioned in the paper, combining EA with UCT to have better exploration and exploitation
